# Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

Welcome to the repository for the Kaggle competition **[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)**. This repository contains simple starter code in  Python, designed to help beginners get started with modeling house prices using XGBoost.

I created these pieces of code to refresh my knowledge of XGBoost and sharpen my coding skills in Python. Each script was developed in about a day. I hope you find them helpful in your journey!

## About the Dataset

The dataset for this competition was compiled by Dean De Cock and serves as a modernized and expanded alternative to the classic Boston Housing dataset. It provides a rich set of features for modeling and is widely used for data science education.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed initial analysis on various numeric and categorical variables to understand the data distribution and relationships. This step helps in identifying patterns and potential issues in the data.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Data Type Fixing**: Corrected data types where necessary.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing values (NAs) using appropriate imputation methods.
- **Categorical Variable Transformation**:
  - Applied one-hot encoding and target encoding to convert categorical variables into numeric formats suitable for modeling.
- **Feature Creation**:
  - Developed simple and intuitive new features to enhance the model (limited feature engineering involved).

## Modeling with XGBoost

- Utilized the XGBoost regressor for modeling.
- Set the objective to optimize the **RMSE of `log(SalePrice)`**, aligning with the competition's evaluation criteria.
- Split the training data into an **80/20 train-test split** for model validation.
  - *Note*: For better model validation, k-fold cross-validation is recommended, especially with larger datasets.

## Packages Used

**Python**

- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [`xgboost`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)
- [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) (for data splitting)

## Possible Improvements

1. ### More EDA and Feature Engineering

   - **Comprehensive Variable Analysis**: Examine all variables to identify those with significant predictive power.
   - **Feature Importance Validation**: Use feature importance metrics to validate and select key variables.
   - **Noise Reduction**: Drop less significant variables to reduce noise and improve model performance.
   - **Iterative Feature Creation**: Continuously create and test new features based on insights from EDA.

2. ### K-Fold Cross-Validation

   - **Implement K-Fold CV**: Use k-fold cross-validation instead of a simple train-test split for more robust validation.
   - **Avoid Information Leakage**: Perform target encoding within each training fold to prevent leakage.

3. ### Hyperparameter Tuning

   - **Thorough Tuning**: Go beyond basic parameters like `max_depth`, `eta`, and `nrounds`.
   - **Tuning Strategies**:
     - **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search over specified parameter values (computationally intensive).
     - **Random Search**: Randomly sample parameter values (less exhaustive but faster).
     - **Bayesian Optimization**: Utilize past evaluation results to choose the next set of parameters.

4. ### Model Ensembling

   - **Incorporate Additional Models**:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest
     - LightGBM
     - CatBoost
     - Deep Learning Models
   - **Ensemble Techniques**: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance.
     - *Note*: While ensembling can boost performance in competitions, consider the trade-offs in complexity and computational cost for real-world applications.

## Conclusion

This starter code provides a foundational approach to tackling the House Prices competition on Kaggle. By expanding on the areas of EDA, feature engineering, model validation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembling, you can significantly enhance model performance and gain deeper insights into predictive modeling.
